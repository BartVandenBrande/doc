## FAQ

### What is payload?

Then you define an event which should be called on button click. It's a payload.

### Does the bot learn overtime (Like Chatterbot) or this one purely depends on input from admin?

No. But perhaps in the future this part will be extended

### Can you alternate between Bot & human or human interfere at later stage ?

Yes. There is special actions for that. To transfer chat to human and to bot.

### Do I have to add "Pattern or event name" ....can add more than one ...for example if someone say "Hi" , Hello , morning , i bring one(1) response?

Yes you can. Just add more than one event.
