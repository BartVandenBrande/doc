A user may or may not get access to change his own user settings by using roles. This is explained in the chapter on modules and functions.
The default account editing screenshot is shown below.

In the screenshot above the user can see his assigned departments. The green text describes whether the user has access to all the departments. When the user has access to all the departments no additional assignment of departments is needed.

If the user doesn't have permission to change his account the input fields won't be accessible. 

New users can be crated from the users list window by clicking the add icon.

While creating a new user the departments can be assigned immediately.

In order to have a fully functional user, users have to be assigned to a group by using the group editing window.

The user editing window is similar to the new user window.

Users are deleted in the same way as groups, roles etc. by clicking the delete icon in the user list window.
