In this tutorial I'll show how to create a simple bot which would collect customers attributes and redirect after that customer to an agent.

## Download
You can download and import bot.
[download](/img/bot/bot.json). Just right click and "save link as"
 
## Triggers

We will need these triggers

 * Default - will be executed once chat starts
 * Prices - just shows prices if users clicks it
 * Collect username - Collects visitor username
 * Unknown - will be executed if bot does not find relevant question
 * Transfer for real - transfers visitor to operator
 * Collect e-mail - collects e-mail
 * Order number - collects order number
