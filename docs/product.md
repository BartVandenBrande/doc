### What is product and for what it can be used?

Let say you are selling few products groups. Like animals and houses. Animals consists of Cat, Dog, Sheep, Houses consist of  Castle, Farm, Flat. So we have in general two departments. 2.42v is required.

Animals and Houses but products would be

1.  Cat
2.  Dog
3.  Sheep
4.  Castle
5.  Farm
6.  Flat

​So if customer chooses Cat chat would be automatically assigned to Animals department.

### How it works?

1.  Go to "System configuration" => "Live help configuration" => "Product" and enable module.
2.  When product module is enabled in embed code generation window will appear product selection box.
3.  If department is chosen all assigned department products will be shown.
4.  If department does not have a product, department selection field will be shown.
5.  Also you can choose what products separately should be shown.
6.  Have in mind that that only product or department selection can be shown at any single time.
