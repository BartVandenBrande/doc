Product feature can be used two ways
 * You can show only product choosing options
 * You can show product based on chosen department
 
In order to activate product functionality you have to go to
> System configuration > Live help configuration > Product

 * In order to enable product module you have to check `Product module is enabled`
 * In order to show products by departments you have to check `Enable products show by departments`
 
So instead of department you will see something like
 
![](/img/product/product.jpg)

If you have checked `Enable products show by departments` you will see something like.

![](/img/product/product-by-department.jpg)

What product will be shown is based on department settings
